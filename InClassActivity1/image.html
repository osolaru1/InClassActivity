<p>
I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will<br> forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.<br>
If you don't like something, change it. If you can't change it, change your attitude.<br>
Prejudice is a burden that confuses the past, threatens the future and renders the present </br>inaccessible.
